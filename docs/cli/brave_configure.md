# brave configure

Configure local host parameters such as storage

```
brave configure
```

## Description

Bravetools requires certain [minimum hardware requirements](../../installation) to operate efficiently. Sensible defaults are generated by Bravetools when `brave init` is run for the first time and stored in `$HOME/.bravetools/config.yaml`.

As the number of deployed units grows, it may be desirable to expand the default allocated storage capacity. Similarly, to conserve host resources, you may wish to shrink the default storage pool size. This can be achieved by modifying the appropriate fields in the `$HOME/.bravetools/config.yaml` file and executing `brave configure` to propagate the changes across your system.

>**NOTE** You must publish your running units to host and ensure that Bravetools runtime does not have any running or stopped units before reconfiguring the storage pool size. This is enforced for now to prevent any inadvertent data loss during host reconfiguration.

## Examples

You storage `config.yaml` parameters may look like this:

```yaml
storage:
  type: zfs
  name: brave-1234567890
  size: 100GB
```

You can expand or shrink zfs storage pool size simply by modifying the `size` option and running:

```bash
brave configure
```

To verify that changes have taken place:

```bash
brave info

NAME                    STATE   IPV4            DISK                    MEMORY                  CPU 
brave-host-name	        Running 192.168.178.49  2.08GB of 96.74GB       28.7 GB of 40.7 GB      8 
```
