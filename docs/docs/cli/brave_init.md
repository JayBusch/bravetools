# brave init

Create a new Bravetools host

```
brave init
```

## Description

When Bravetools is installed for the first time, it will set up all required components to connect your host to LXD.

`brave init` will:

* Create `~/.bravetools` directory that stores all your local images, configurations, and a live Unit database

On Mac and Windows platforms:

* Create a new Multipass instance of Ubuntu 18.04
* Install snap LXD
* Enable mounting between host and Multipass

On Linux distributions:

* Set up a new LXD profile `brave`
* Create a new LXD bridge `bravebr0`
* Create a new storage pool `brave-TIMESTAMP`

These steps ensure that Bravetools establishes a connection with LXD server and runs a self-contained LXD environment that doesn't interfere with any potentially existing profiles and LXD bridges.

## Options
