# brave mount

Mount a directory to a Unit

```
brave mount [UNIT:]<source> UNIT:<target>
```

## Description

`brave mount` enables binding of local directories between a host and a running Unit:

```bash
brave mount $PWD/DIR UNITNAME:/PATH/TO/DIR
```

Note that the mount requires a full path to your host directory and host directory and target directory have to have an identical name.

Since Bravetools deploys unpriveledged containers, the fact that all uids/gids in an unprivileged container are mapped to a normally unused range on the host means that sharing of data between host and container is effectively impossible. This is circumvented internally by Bravetools by directly mapping your host uid/gid to a Bravetools Unit through `lxc config set test raw.idmap`. This enables users to read/write bound volumes inside an unpriveledged container.

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for mount
```
