# Introduction to Bravetools

Welcome to Bravetools! This introduction will show you what Bravetools is and why it exists. Check out some of our [use cases](use_cases) to explore the benefits that Bravetools can offer. The list is not exhaustive and we're excited to see new applications in the very near future.

# What is Bravetools

Bravetools is an open source tool for creating and managing System Containers on multiple platforms. Bravetools is lightweight and runs on every major operating system. It is not a replacement for Docker. In fact, [Docker can be easily incorporated](../docs/docker) into machine images at build-time.

A Bravetools image is a single static environment that contains a pre-configured operating system and installed software which is then used to quickly create new operational Units.
